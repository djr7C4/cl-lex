(defmacro define-string-lexer (name &body patterns)
  "Defines a function that takes a string and keyword arguments for the start and end of the string and returns a closure
that takes no arguments and will return the next token each time it is called.  When the input string is exhausted or no more
matches are found the closure will return nil.  Each pattern must be a regular expression or a list of one regular
expression or a list containing a regular expression as the first element and the rest of the elements of the list forming
an implicit progn.  If a pattern is a regular expression or a list of one element, then text in the string that matches the
regular expression is ignored.  If a pattern is a list of two elements then when the regular expression matches text the
sub-strings that match each register in the regular expression are bound to the symbols that represent the registers.  Any
text that matches named registers is bound to a variable with the same name as the register name.  If the same name is used
for more than one register then subsequent have the appropriate index appended to their names.  If a register is not named,
then text that matches it is bound to $i where i is the index of the register.  The entire matching sub-string is bound to
$@.  If no text matches a register then its variable is bound to nil.  All symbols are interned in the current package when
the macro is expanded.  The start and end variables passed to the function are accessible from inside the implicit progn's
from the patterns.  Patterns are applied in the order they are provided and multiple patterns cannot be applied to the
same piece of text.  Any text that is not matched to a pattern is skipped.  The behavior of the regular expressions can be
modified by setting the appropriate variables in the cl-ppcre regex library."
