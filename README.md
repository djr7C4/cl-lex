# cl-lex
cl-lex is a set of Common Lisp macros for generating lexical analyzers automatically.  Registers (including named registers) can be accessed by number or name in token generation code.  The [cl-ppcre](http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/) library is used for implementing regular expressions.  Lexers generated using cl-lex can be used with [cl-yacc](http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/cl-yacc/).
